## Summary

This project uses a fictional dataset of drug treatments for the fictional company Pymaceuticals Inc. The goal was to analyze the effects of three drug treatments and a placebo on the spread of cancer in mice. Pandas was used to manipulate the data, and Matplotlib was used to create the plots. The analysis found that Capomulin was the only drug out of the three (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril) that reduced tumor volume. Infubinol reduced the spread of metastatic sites more than Ketapril and the placebo, but was not as effective as Capomulin. Also, Ketapril was no more effective than a placebo. It was clear that Capomulin was the most effective drug.
